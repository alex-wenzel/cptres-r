# cptres-r
A collection of R scripts to drive clustering of single cell RNA-seq from CAOV3 clones with varying resistance to carboplatin

This repository mostly serves as a way for me to version control my analysis especially when I start needing to jump between EC2 instances. In the spirit of open source research, I will try to document more successful scripts and prune unhelpful ones from the master branch, but don't expect that to be up to date, and take each of these scripts with a very large grain of salt.
